# Sound Files

## benchmark-complete.mp3

This file should contain a short retro beep sound (0.5-1 second duration).

### How to add:
1. Download a free retro beep/blip sound from:
   - https://freesound.org/ (search for "8-bit beep" or "retro beep")
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
   - Generate one using: https://sfxr.me/

2. Save as `benchmark-complete.mp3` in this directory

3. The sound should be:
   - Short (0.5-1 second)
   - Retro/8-bit style
   - Not too loud (code sets volume to 0.5)

### Note:
The benchmark theme will work without this file, but won't play completion sounds.
